# rn-assignment3-11358105
My name is Chelsea Adeniji with student ID 11358105.
In this project , I used react native to code the app so it will look like the UI design given to us in the assignment.
In this assignment , i made use of the view component which is fundamentally used to build user interfaces .
I also used the text component which is used to display text.
I used scrollview which is a scrolling container that has a lot of components within it that lets the user scroll vertically and horizontally.
In this project you will see the textinput component which makes room for users to input data.
The stylesheet component was used to help design and plan the structure of the app.
The button component is a clickable component that makes it possible for users to click on items.
The Flatlist component is used for long lists that do not need partitioning unlike the sectionlist where the list is divided into groups.
Images component helps displays pictures to make the Interface more lively.
